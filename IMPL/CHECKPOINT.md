# Build Loop Checkpoint

State cursor for the [[LOOP]]. Updated automatically by the agent at the end of every commit.

**Do not edit by hand** while the loop is running — race conditions vs the agent.

## Current cursor

- **Last completed task:** 3.6 — Sim-clock interface: Clock interface (now/schedule/schedulePeriodic) in ems-core, Timestamp value object (epoch-millis), SimulatedClock (TreeMap-sorted, monotonicity guard, period>0 guard, advanceTo/advanceBy, periodic via recursive self-scheduling). 14 tests in SimulatedClockTest; discriminating out-of-order-fires-in-time-order test, callback sees correct now(), golden two-clock equivalence, all guards. Event-time-driven advancement deferred — LogRecord has no occurred_at yet.
- **Last commit (main):** `feat(3.6): sim-clock interface — Clock, Timestamp, SimulatedClock`
- **Last commit sha (main):** `5733929`
- **Tasks merged/marked this session:** 3.5 done `b0cc12b`, 3.6 done `5733929`
- **In-progress task:** _(none)_
- **WIP branch:** main
- **Last updated:** 2026-06-08
- **Next task:** **3.7** (Configuration service, sonnet, unblocked by 3.1+3.5+3.6).
- **Total progress:** **54 of 144 tasks [x]** (37.5%). Phase 0 all [x]: 0.1–0.10.
- **Hold-pending-rework branches:** 4.11 (InstrumentCore byte mismatch), 6.4 (reject codes need catalog extension — field-format codes don't exist in catalog; design decision required before marking done), 13.4 (dashboards at 9/9/6 panels vs 24/12/12 targets), 11.2-11.10 (abandoned WIP branch — empty files, reset to `[ ]`).

## Open WIP branches

| Branch | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wip/6.4-validation-rules` | 6.4 | **needs rework** | 185 per-asset validation rules. Reject codes misaligned: uses sequential `EMS-ORD-1001/1002/…` for field-format checks, but catalog uses those codes for different semantics. Rules also cover concepts absent from catalog. Sonnet must decide: extend catalog with new codes, or remap to closest existing. Do not merge until reconciled. |

## Session log

The loop appends a one-line entry per session.

## Blocked tasks

Loop adds `[!]` tasks here for human review.

| Task ID | Reason | First flagged |
|---|---|---|
| _(none)_ | | |

## Abandoned wip branches

Loop adds entries when a wip branch is older than 48h and gets reset.

| Branch | Task ID | Reset at | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wip/11.2-11.10-fix-adapters` | 11.2–11.10 | 2026-06-07 | All 10 Java files were empty (1 newline each). Commit message described 1910 lines that were never written. Tasks reset to `[ ]`. |
